# 4. Questions
------------
##### Meeting Minutes (Discussed Questions)
* Ads for properties to be sold: What are differences in respect to their fields, compared to rentals? - *Just be reasonsable*
* Auctions: Which specific features / modes are to be supported (e.g. direct buy, ...)? - *Plain auction, nothing fancy*
* Closing: What happens if a deal is established, both, in reference to rentals and sells. - *Nothing, really... except probably a message to inform the parties*
* Extend search to include more filter critieria - which ones? - *the more important ones of those already in the filter that shows with the results*
* Should features for site admins be planned? Their capabilities would include unrestricted user, flat- and property management. - *Not at this stage*
* Alerts: When normal users get alerts "a bit late" - how much late? - *No clear answer, make it an option*
* How are deals established - *Send an e-mail to both parties and remove ad*
